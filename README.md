# odin-recipes
a repo for my odin project 'recipes'!

This recipe project is a simple way to demonstrate my new found understanding of HTML. It's not pretty, but it's a great way to solidify my learnings. Next stop CSS, but for now let's keep things simple. :) 

Key learnings utilised in this project are as follows:
- HTML boilerplate 
- Appropriate HTML syntax and clean code
- Element creation
- Use of tags (p, a, img etc.) and attributes (href, alt, src) 
- Unordered and ordered lists 
- Parent and child (nested) elements 
- Using absoloute and relative links 
- Using appropriate image formats
- Creating an accessible website that is SEO friendly and accessible
- Creating additional website pages, structuring my project files appropriately.
- Adding comments regularly!

Let's see how this goes!
