        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a Pad Thai recipe that truly stacks up to great 
            Thai restaurants yet is totally doable for every home cook 
            with just a trip to your every day grocery store. With 
            the slippery noodles, signature sweet-savoury flavour, sprinkle 
            of peanuts and tang from lime, this is a Thai food favourite for 
            good reason!</p>
        <p>Pad Thai is one of the world’s most beloved noodle dishes. Along 
            with Thai Green Curry and Red Curry, this is the dish by which 
            every Thai restaurant is measured. In fact, I was trying to find 
            the “best” Thai restaurant in my area just last week and it brought 
            me much amusement that Pad Thai was the baseline of a favourable 
            or unfavourable rating for almost every review!</p>
