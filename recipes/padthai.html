    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a Pad Thai recipe that <em>truly</em> stacks up to great 
        Thai restaurants yet is totally doable for every home cook 
        with just a trip to your every day grocery store. With 
        the <em>slippery noodles, signature sweet-savoury flavour, sprinkle 
        of peanuts and tang from lime</em>, this is a Thai food favourite for 
        good reason!</p>
    <p>Pad Thai is one of the world’s most beloved noodle dishes. Along 
        with <strong><a href="thaigreencurry.html">Thai Green Curry</a></strong> and <strong><a href="redcurry.html">Red Curry</a></strong>, this is the dish by which 
        every Thai restaurant is measured. In fact, I was trying to find 
        the “best” Thai restaurant in my area just last week and it brought 
        me much amusement that Pad Thai was the baseline of a favourable 
        or unfavourable rating for almost every review!</p>
